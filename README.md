Auto Production Data Analysis Using R to perform multiple linear regression test, t-tests, and create summary statistics of production data on an auto prototype.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A multiple linear regression test was performed using the following variables to predict MPG:
* Vehicle length
* Vehicle weight
* spoiler angle
* ground clearance
* AWD

The results are presented below in figure 1.

### Results
Based on the result output for the linear regression test, vehicle length, ground clearance, and the y-intercept were found to be statistically significant in contributing to the variance to the MPG variable with a p value < 0.05.
